The origin of the word and the birth of television

The word "television" comes from the Greek "tele" (far away) and the Latin "visio" (vision). In our country, television has gone through a huge development path – from mechanical to electronic and digital. It can be argued that no other media outlet has such a rich and rapidly developing history.

Today it is difficult to imagine that it was possible to view an image not on the screen of a conventional kinescope, but on a rotating metal disk with holes through which light fell on a photocell installed opposite, which turned it into electrical signals. The image was decomposed by rotating the disk. The fast rotation of the disk allowed the viewer to see the whole picture. The birth of television begins with this simple optical-mechanical device for line-by-line scanning, invented by German student Paul Nipkov.

The history of television is the history of research, inventions, and technical experiments. Television doesn't have a single inventor. From the very beginning, the development of ideas for the electrical transmission of images has been international. By the beginning of the 20th century, at least two dozen projects had been put forward, including five in Russia, under the names "telephotograph", "electric telescope", "telephot", etc.

Thus, the project of the world's first television image transmission system was proposed in 1880 by a Russian scientist, Professor Porfiry Ivanovich Bakhmetyev..

The scheme proposed by him later formed the basis of television. To transmit an image over a distance, according to the scientist, it must first be decomposed into separate elements, then the elements are sequentially transmitted and reassembled into a single whole. Bakhmetyev called such a possible television system a "telephoto camera." It was not possible to practically implement it at that time, there was no material and technical base.

In 1907, Boris Lvovich Rosing, a professor at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, whom the whole world considers the founder of electronic television, after many years of experimentation, patented a method of "electric telescoping", that is, transmitting images over a distance using a cathode ray tube. Rosing's experiments were a continuation of the technology of decomposing a television image into a number of elements with transmission over communication channels and their re-creation by the receiving system. Rosing saw the only correct way to implement television in the use of electronic devices, and this task, he believed, could be solved only with the help of an electron beam. This bold conclusion was made by the scientist at a time when electronics itself was in its infancy. Rosing's ideas were developed by his student Vladimir Zvorykin, who emigrated to America in 1919 and became the "inventor of American electronic television."

Legend has it that the first victim of his experiments was a coffee table in which Nipkov drilled many holes arranged in an Archimedes spiral. Nipkov's next victim was his modest savings, which he spent on the purchase of a patent, which he received a year later, on January 15, 1885. This patent for an "electric telescope" (later known as the Nipkov disk), which would later be widely used in mechanical television, made Nipkov famous, and the disk became an important element of so–called mechanical television for several decades (in our country, for example, until the early 1940s). But after receiving a patent for the invention, the young researcher was unable to develop his device, and after 15 years the patent was revoked due to lack of interest in the invention. By this time, Paul Nipkov was already working as a designer at the Berlin Institute and was no longer interested in the subject of image transmission.

It will take another two decades before this invention will be in demand.

Interestingly, Paul Nipkov first saw the practical application of his invention 40 years later, in 1928, at one of the international exhibitions of radio engineering achievements in Berlin. "Finally, I can be calm," he shared his impressions of watching a mechanical TV. I saw a shimmering surface on which something was moving, although it was impossible to distinguish what exactly."

The construction of a transmitting device and receiver (with a Nipkov disk) was actively carried out at the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute in Moscow. The created system produced an image decomposed into 30 lines (1200 elements). Professor P. V. Shmakov recalls the first days of the device's operation: "The screen is the size of a matchbox and the program that we managed to "catch" is a dancing couple. She's in white, he's in black. She waved her handkerchief goodbye, and he lit a cigarette. Smoke was visible. That's all. It's uncomplicated, nothing fantastic, but the broadcast overcame a thousand-kilometer space, it was a small victory for man over space, and that alone made his chest swell" (Uzilevsky V. The Legend of the Crystal Egg. L.: Lenizdat, 1965).
The first experimental television broadcast

Experimental television broadcasting with a 30-line mechanical scanning system started in 1929-1931 in the leading countries of the world almost simultaneously. The 30-line format, created in Germany, has actually become an international standard.

After a number of experimental television communication sessions, it was decided to conduct trial television broadcasts. For this purpose, equipment from the laboratory of the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute was moved to the building of the Moscow Radio Broadcasting Center at 7 Nikolskaya Street, from where it was possible to send a signal to broadcast radio transmitters and where a small studio was equipped. The first trial broadcast took place on the night of October 1, 1931 through the radio station of the Moscow Council of Trade Unions. It is not known how many televisions were receiving her at that moment, but contemporaries claimed that there were at least ten of them. The broadcasts have become regular. The content of these broadcasts was not specially prepared, it was an amateur performance. And I had to perform in a dark studio, which was illuminated by a "running beam" created by the light of a powerful film lamp covered with a rotating Nipkov disk.
The first domestic TV show

Information about the first broadcast television program on October 1, 1931
Broadcasts addressed to radio viewers, as those who hosted television broadcasts were then called, were conducted on the basis of a solid program. However, there were very few televisions. The screen size did not exceed the size of a matchbox. According to current concepts, the technology of television in the early 1930s looks extremely modest, but it was then, in 1931, that television became a practical reality, and this is an invaluable merit of the pioneers.

The country's first set of television equipment, through which broadcasts were transmitted from the Moscow Radio Broadcasting Center, was created by the outstanding scientist Pavel Vasilyevich Shmakov. By the way, he came up with the idea of using an airplane flying between signal transmission and reception points as a repeater. This idea of the scientist was developed during the World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow in 1957 and at the meeting of the first cosmonaut of the Planet Yuri Gagarin in 1961.

Since mechanical television broadcasts are conducted on medium and long waves, they can be received everywhere, and the television center in Moscow could cover almost the entire territory of the USSR. Electronic television transmissions can be carried out only on ultrashort waves, which propagate only within the line of sight from the antenna of the transmitter to the antenna of the receiver. Therefore, if Soviet television had started as electronic, only residents of Moscow and the suburbs could have shown interest in it. Of course, such a limited coverage area of the television center would not have made it possible for the idea of television to be widely disseminated. Interest in television, aroused by the first experimental broadcasts, stimulated the growth of public demand for it.

In order to cover the vast territory of the country with television broadcasting, it was necessary either to build a sufficient number of program television centers, or to connect cities and villages with a network of cable or radio relay lines. The development of Soviet television in the 1950s followed the first path.

Mechanical television had one significant drawback – very low image quality. There couldn't be anything else on such a small screen. To enlarge the screen to the size of an average photograph (9 x 12 cm), the disc in the camera had to be more than two meters in diameter. For about 20 years, electronic and mechanical television competed with each other, and it was only by the early 1940s that the latter had to give way to a more advanced and promising system.

In most developed countries, experimental television broadcasts via electronic TV systems, which eventually pushed mechanical television aside, began between 1936 and 1940.
Mechanical television broadcasts from Moscow ceased in December 1938 with the launch of a new television center on Shabolovka, based on electronic principles.

  <div class="box box2">
	</div>
		 <div class="box box2">I must say that at one time, namely in the late noughties, Rutub was quite competitive with YouTube in our country, but in the early tenth, both bloggers and users began to actively switch to YouTube. It is not clear why Rutub was suddenly left behind. Maybe the "effective" managers from Gazprom Media intervened in the matter, who recently completely bought out the service? Who knows...

In 2012, the design of the Rutube changed, but did it benefit? It always seemed uncomfortable to me when compared with the same YouTube. But somehow it turned out that the service was not unprofitable, since it continued to live. Gazprom is not profitable to support Frankenstein, especially after their history with the Super channel. Just like any other corporation.

In 2021, Rutub carried out a redesign, which resulted in the "Rutube Studio", which is similar to the creative studio of YouTube. The authors tried to make it more like YouTube. Then some people had the prerequisites that YouTube would be blocked in our country.
	</div>
  <div class="box box2">On YouTube, before uploading a video, they warn that it should weigh no more than 10 GB and 5 hours. Because I have already uploaded 20 GB of video to my YouTube channel, and streamed more than 5 hours there, these rules are not there. Moreover, you can upload 5 videos on YouTube at the same time, compared to 10 on YouTube.

Moderation is an ambiguous thing. On the one hand, the video can be released on Youtube immediately after moderation is completed, and in good quality. On the other hand, this moderation can last all day, which, to me, is the main disadvantage of the platform. I do not know why exactly, but moderation checked one of my videos for about 6 hours (+/- a couple of hours), regardless of the timing. Plus, there was a long download, which is associated with an unexpected influx of users to the video hosting. After all, who could have imagined that there would be such a large influx in 2022? </div>
			  <div class="box box2">But with YouTube there is the same parallel, only in a different way. The video can be accessed immediately after uploading and processing. Initially, the quality will be 360p. It will take a couple of hours for Full HD video, but for 4K video (for example, a review on the Corpse Party Book of Shadows) it will take half a day, as in the situation with Rutub. </div>
				  <div class="box box2">For at least six months, you can safely log into YouTube and not be afraid that you will be thrown out of your profile and you need to log in again. The problem arises only if you keep several YouTube accounts in the same browser. I don't know how all this should work, but if I add additional accounts, then soon it breaks my system, and I have to add additional accounts again. Only I have such a mistake or someone else, I have no idea. </div>
					  <div class="box box2">Rutub has a simple scheme. One account - and no more. Do you need to get into the second one? Exit the first one and enter the second one manually. All this, of course, will be compensated by autofilling the username and password (if you saved it in the browser), however, the sediment remains. After all, there is a difference between one mouse click and five (and keystrokes, depending on autofill).

Before the update: The Rutuba system worked even worse, like a goldfish's memory. With each of your visits to the service, you need to log in yourself. </div>	
			  <div class="box box2">Similar to the design. The Rutub player was created without any bells and whistles. You can scroll forward/backward for 10 seconds, adjust the volume, expand the video to the full page (as well as the screen), change the playback speed and video quality. Youtube, in addition, has support for subtitles, autoplay of the next video, as well as annotations. It turns out that the Rootube player is for easy use, and the YouTube one with a preponderance in advantage. But on the other hand, the Rutub player initially has a picture-in-picture function, rather than YouTube (it is paid). </div>
			  <div class="box box2">I do not know how you can screw up or abandon such a feature as video evaluation? As you may know, dislikes are disabled on YouTube. There is an opportunity to put them, but neither we, nor the other, nor even the author himself can see the number of dislikes. It is enough to install the appropriate browser extension, and everything goes back to normal. </div>
			<div class="box box2">With Rutub, the situation is even better, or rather, worse than the insanity that YouTube has done. That is, we can't even see how many likes. With a recent update, they added "to the top". Now we can't even know if we're going to watch a worthwhile video or some kind of bullshit. Why do we need a rating system when there is a "top"? Would add "I like"/"Class", if they don't want to "Like". But "in the top"... And if this video is "not top"? I wonder if Rutub will add its own anti-rating, where all videos in which the number of "not top" significantly exceeds "in the top" will be compiled? </div>
				<div class="box box2">Before the update: The same as with the assessment. Only the situation is even worse. There is no such possibility as "leave a comment" stupidly.

Now you can comment on the video. I can't remember what has happened since 2012, since the first redesign, or rather, what has changed. Because before the redesign, there was an opportunity to leave a comment. In principle, there is no difference from the YouTube settings, with a few exceptions. You can't sort comments by time or popularity, like on YouTube. They are going at random.
Sponsorship

YouTube allows bloggers to enable sponsorship on their channel. Whoever sponsors the channel on a monthly basis will receive a privilege in the comments and in the chat, and he will also have access to sponsor-exclusive content from the blogger he decided to finance. The Rutube does not have such a function. </div>
			<div class="box box2">No matter how hard I try to look for advantages from Rutube, I must admit that so far it is losing to Youtube in terms of functionality and moderation. Plus, the owners clearly wanted to turn the Rootube into actually a second box, with a pinch of blogger content. Roughly speaking, we have a YouTube service for the beginning of 2012-2013. The owners will have to work significantly on the functionality of the Rutube for both bloggers and users.

Some people shout that Rutub is not needed, because it is only for local show-offs, and YouTube has its privileges, that's where we need to go. I would agree with that, but we always have one "but". There is a confrontation between the RCN and YouTube, which has reached its peak, so the blocking of YouTube, I think, is not far off. Also, some will not be stopped by blocking, and they will log on to YouTube via VPN. Well... The flag is in their hands.

I don't think that Rutub will only be a local video hosting service. Of course, it will not spread to the whole world, but it will work in Russia and the CIS countries, and nearby countries can also connect there. </div>
